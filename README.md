AIPI 590 - XAI | Assignment 8: Mechanistic Interpretability

We train a small MLP to predict the parity of the number of 1s in an 8-bit binary string then analyze the internals of the model using several mechanistic interpretability methods.

Question: Which neurons are involved in detecting parity, and how do the neurons encode information about parity?
